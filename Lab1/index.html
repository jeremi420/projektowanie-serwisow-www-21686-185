        <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
            glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
            my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>
        
        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
            and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
            turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
            oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
            lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>
        
        <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
            can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends,
            like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr
            Glass. </p>

        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
            Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he
            is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
            and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord
            when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>
